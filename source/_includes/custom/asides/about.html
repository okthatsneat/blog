<h2>about me</h2>
<p>I financed my computer science studies running a publicity and booking agency 
<a href="http://www.pullproxy.com">PullProxy.com</a>
and recently finished the bachelor program with a Ruby on Rails app that does music discovery you can find on 
<a href="https://github.com/philipphofmannHTW/Feed-Player">GitHub</a>.
I'm currently looking for new projects that involve programming (hire me).
