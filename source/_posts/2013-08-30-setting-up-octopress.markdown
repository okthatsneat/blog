## You are actually reading my first blog post ever.

Kind of embarrassing, sure - but just like starting to write tests for your code (cough), never too late. 
So why now? I looking for a challenging new project (translates: I need a job), and besides making friends with 5 other programmers of your intended language / framework, starting a blog was the most common advise I came by. A good compilation of such advise was recently published by [Thoughtbot](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/post/59405543569/giant-robots-podcast-episode-63-knowledge-bomb "Thoughtbot Podcast: knowledge bomb").

Since I just spent 5 months hacking on a Ruby (on Rails) project, I chose the most popular bogging engine listed by [Ruby Toolbox](https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/categories/Blog_Engines) - that site has never let me down. 

Really, the most challenging part here was to come up with a "creative" domain name - I'd really like to cloak the fact that I'm a little new to this by not using the .herokuapp.com domain. Solution: phrase the general reaction you'd want your readers to have when reading one of your posts. Feeling accomplished already!

After chipping out some virtual â‚¬ to Godaddy, you get to click "launch" on your domain name, and edit the CNAME property of "www" to [your_heroku_app_name.herokuapp.com] in your DNS manager. I set TTL to half an hour, impatiently. 

And of course I followed the getting started instructions over at [Octopress.com](http://octopress.org/docs/setup/ "Octopress setup").

This first post was then written inside Sublime Text 2 that keeps popping up a window asking my to buy it, and I think that's the only reason I haven't done so yet. But they do make an awesome IDE, featuring a [spell checker](http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/2/spell_checking.html "Sublime Text 2 spellchecker") that makes this post a little less bad.

I guess I'll have to get into the [Markdown syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax "Markdown syntax") and the [Liquid template language](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki/Liquid-for-Designers "Liquid on Github") now that I'm blogging in it. 

Oh, and of course to properly spy on you I also got myself a neat Google Analytics tracking ID that I configured Octopress with.
I'll dive into what that does If I'm still interested in it tomorrow and report on my findings in another post. 

Also up next: making this blog less ugly, and exploring everything that makes it look fancy to get me hired, preferably writing Ruby code. 

Cheers!
